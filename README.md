# How to run

No need. It runs [via its own cron](https://github.com/TurboLabIt/godaddy-tools/blob/master/config/custom/cron). The 
cron file is deployed by [deploy.sh](https://github.com/TurboLabIt/godaddy-tools/blob/master/scripts/deploy.sh).

If you still want to run it manually:


````shell
bash /var/www/godaddy-tools/scripts/app-download-domains.sh

````

The generated files are in `/var/www/godaddy-tools/var/domains/*.csv`. CSV older than *some* days are deleted 
via [cleaner.sh](https://github.com/TurboLabIt/godaddy-tools/blob/master/scripts/cleaner.sh) (executed via cron).


# How to update

No need. It updates [automatically](https://github.com/TurboLabIt/godaddy-tools/blob/master/scripts/auto-update.sh) 
every day via cron, if a new revision was merged on *master*.

If you still want to update it manually:

````shell
bash /var/www/godaddy-tools/scripts/deploy.sh

````
